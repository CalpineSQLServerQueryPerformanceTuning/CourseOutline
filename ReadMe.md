## **Training Overview**
Accelebrate's SQL Server Query Performance Tuning training course teaches attendees everything they need to know to tune their SQL queries and improve execution speed.  Students learn how to fix relational design issues in their databases, create execution plans, collect performance data, add indexes to boost performance, and utilize statistics to deal with skewed data distribution.

**Note:** This SQL Server course is appropriate for versions to 2012-2019.
